  * P28. If you don't do well on either, well, there's always business school.

  * P39. I'm a very busy man, and if you are not prepared and you do not have your questions formulated, please do not come here again.

  * p51. I wanted to go somewhere that was more merit-oriented. Besides, you look at Harvard, it's the fruit of industry. MIT is industry.

  * P59. Getting an education at MIT is like getting a drink of water from a fire hose.

  * P62. When you work on energy, pretend you're running a mining operation. Focus your effects on finding and extracting the most out of the concentrated areas of what you're mining. Don't worry about recovering anything from the slag heap. You'll spend more time and energy than you'll ever get out of it.

  * p79. The first rule is "It's your job and not mine." The second is "I don't take any excuses,"...

  * P85. If you don't know what you're doing, the first thing to do is to try to look like you know what you're doing. That buys you time.

  * P92. The MIT motto is "Mens et Manus" - "Mind and Hand."

  * P96.

"They're bright young people, but there are many demands on their time and it might impede their progress on the research," he said.

"Do you mean to tell us that the people you're producing for us won't be able to write a brief paragraph once a month saying what they've accomplished and where they're headed?" Sharma retorted.

Professor Heywood hedged without flinching. He was still in control, the quintessential grantsman. "Perhaps the reports could be prepared every two months," he said. He knew that he would have to review them, that his secretary would have to type them, that he might have to meet with the whole group just to discuss that one subject. It could easily kill a morning that would be better spent writing his book.

"Every two months would be fine with me," Sharma said, and the others agreed.

  * P97. ... the MIT professor goal - getting tenure and starting a multimillion-dollar company.

  * P97. To hyperarchieve you have to be hyperorganized.

  * P118. It's just one of the principles of good engineering - redundant systems.

  * P127. The steps in the scientific method are:
    1. statement of the problem;
    1. hypotheses as to the cause of the problem;
    1. experiments designed to test each hypothesis;
    1. predicted results of the experiments;
    1. observed results of the experiments; and
    1. conclusions from the result of the experiments

  * P 127. An experiment is never a failure solely because it fails to achieve predicted results. And experiment is a failure only when it also fails adequately to test the hypothesis in question, when the data it produces don't prove anything one way or another.

  * P 152. We're trying to teach you to make decisions based on limited time and resources. That's what the real world is like all the time.

  * P158. "Not the quarry but the chase; not the laurel but the race" (Burgess, 1885)

  * P168. Why I Want to Be a TV Star
    1. I want to be rich.
    1. I want to be famous.
    1. I want to be a professor at MIT and this might help.
    1. Ever since I was a child I've had a fascination with perpetual motion machines and this would be a dream come true for me.
    1. I already know the answer. It's impossible to prove some thing's a perpetual motion machine because however long it runs there's always going to be some more perpetuity during which you can't know whether it will still run because you aren't there yet.

  * "Well." Zing, pelt. "I...", Pelt "... can't accept the award without first consulting my lawyer."

# 畢業設計只要做 1 次 #

P55. 建築師查理士摩爾(Charles W. Moore)提出一個叫做「記憶宮殿」的理論，他認為建築師將所有美好的體驗與視覺經驗存放在記憶中，就好像是在自己的大腦中打造一座美麗的宮殿一樣，等到需要做設計的時候，回到這座記憶中的宮殿去尋找答案，做出好的設計。


P87.現代主義大師密斯凡德羅(Mies van der Rohe)提出「簡單美學」(Less is more)，應用在建築設計的的現代的解釋是：「空間的層次要豐富，造型可以很簡單」。後來的人提出「簡單無聊」(Less is bore)做為諷刺。


P93.德國文學家歌德(Johann W. von Goethe)稱建築為「在空間裡凍結的音樂」。


p111.荷蘭人自誇「上帝造海，荷蘭人造陸」，荷蘭人土地有三分之二在海平面以下，填海造地的技術一流。
